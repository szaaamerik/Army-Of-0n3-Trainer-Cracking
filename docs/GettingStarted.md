# Getting Started

Alright, listen up, you wannabe hackers.<br/>
Today, I'm gonna show you how to crack a certain trainer using just Cheat Engine and Fiddler Classic.<br/>
Yeah, you heard me right. This trainer thinks it's got some fancy security with its two APIs – old and new.<br/>
But guess what? It's about as secure as a paper bag in a hurricane.

## Bypassing the Bullshit: Straight to the Crack.

First things first, forget about all that "understanding the API" bullshit.<br/>
We're diving straight into the action. No need to waste time analyzing or identifying entry points.<br/> 
We're going for the jugular.

## Cracking the Trainer: Proving a Point

So here's the deal: I cracked the old API, didn't release anything, and tried to play nice with the creator for a bug bounty.<br/>
But now, I've gone and fucked up the new API in about 10 minutes flat.<br/> 
And what does the creator do? Doubts my skills.<br/>
So, here I am, writing this guide and giving it away for free, just to prove a point.

## Unveiling the Weakness: Cracking the Trainer with Brutal Simplicity

You wanna know how pathetic this trainer's security really is? Stick around, and I'll show you.<br/>
We're gonna tear through it like a hot knife through butter.<br/>
No fancy tools, no advanced techniques – just good ol' Cheat Engine and Fiddler Classic. Let's do this.

## Distinguishing Between Old and New: Identifying API Versions

Alright, so you want to crack a trainer, but first, you need to know which API it's using – old or new.<br/>
Here's the deal: any trainer released before April 7 is likely using the old API.<br/> 
So, before you dive into cracking, take a quick peek at the release date.

## Diving into the Depths: Cracking the Old and New APIs – Two Guides, One Goal

So here's the deal: cracking the old and new APIs of this trainer are two separate beasts.<br/> 
They share some similarities, but they each have their own quirks and weaknesses.<br/>
That's why I've split this guide into two separate files, one for cracking the old API and another for cracking the new API.

- [Cracking the Old API](OldApi.md): In this guide, we'll dive into the tactics needed to dismantle the security measures of the old API. Get ready to flex those cracking skills and uncover the vulnerabilities lurking beneath the surface.
- [Cracking the New API](NewApi.md): Here, we'll take on the challenge of breaking through the defenses of the new API. It might seem daunting, but with the right approach and a little determination, we'll conquer it like champs.

So pick your poison, crack open those markdown files, and let's get cracking!
